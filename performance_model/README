The regression model of overlap of data transfer and gpu computing.
1 construction the model
    1) time_compute.py compute the time of Tgpu, Tg2c and Tc2g for several data size
    2) run the glmem-overlap-CG.cu using nvprof to get the Tgpu, Tg2c and Tc2g (the same data size with step 1) )
    3) based on the computed data and measured data, regression_multivarible.py could compute the c1 and c2 coefficients, and get the model
2 validate the model
    1) list some new data size
    2) use the model to comptue the predicted time for the data size in 1)
    3) run the glmel-overlap-CG.cu get the time
    4) compare the predicted time and the measured time

the error is under 10%, mainly around 5% and with the data size increase the error decrease.
